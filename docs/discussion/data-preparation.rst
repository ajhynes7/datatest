Test Driven Data-Wrangling
##########################

In the practice of data science, data preparation is a huge part of
the job. Practitioners often spend 50 to 80 percent of their time
wrangling data [1]_ [2]_ [3]_ [4]_.  This critically important phase
is time-consuming, unglamorous, and often poorly structured.

The :mod:`datatest` package was created to support test driven
data-wrangling and provide a disciplined approach to an otherwise
messy process.

A datatest suite can facilitate quick edit-test cycles to help guide
the selection, cleaning, integration, and formatting of data. Data tests
can also help to automate check-lists, measure progress, and promote
best practices.

Structuring a Test Suite

.. epigraph::

    *"Unix was not designed to stop you from doing stupid things,
    because that would also stop you from doing clever things."*
    ---Doug Gwyn [5]_

The structure of a datatest suite defines a data preparation workflow.
The first tests should address essential prerequisites and the following
tests should focus on specific requirements.

Typically, data tests should be defined in the following order:

 1. load data sources (asserts that expected source data is present)
 2. check for expected column names
 3. validate format of values (data type or other regex)
 4. assert set-membership requirements
 5. assert sums, counts, or cross-column values

.. note::

    Datatest's built-in test runner executes tests ordered
    by file name and then by line number within each file.
    You can control the order that tests are run by arranging
    the order they appear in the test file itself.

Data Preparation Workflow
*************************

Using a quick edit-test cycle, users can:

 1. focus on a failing test
 2. make small changes to the data
 3. re-run the suite to check that the test now passes
 4. then, move on to the next failing test

The work of cleaning and formatting data takes place outside of the
datatest package itself.  Users can work with with the tools they find
the most productive (Excel, `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_, R,
sed, etc.).
