    :description: A discussion about when it's appropriate to assert
                  data requirements and when it's appropriate to accept
                  deviations.

Validation vs Acceptance
########################

..
    validate adherance to a lose requirement
    or accept specified deviation

    what's the difference?
    does it matter?

    quicker to validate loose requirement
    than it is to generate a bunch of differences that must then be accepted
    but unless executing time is prohibitive, favor semantic accuracy over
    misleading-optimization
