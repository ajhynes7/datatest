Datatest: Test driven data-wrangling and data validation
########################################################

Version |release|

Datatest helps to speed up and formalize data-wrangling and data
validation tasks. It was designed to work with poorly formatted
data by detecting and describing validation failures.

* |Validate| the format, type, set membership, and more from a variety of
  data sources including pandas ``DataFrames`` and ``Series``, NumPy
  ``ndarrays``, built-in data structures, etc.
* Smart |comparison behavior| applies the appropriate validation method for
  a given data requirement.
* Automatic |data handling| manages the validation of single elements,
  sequences, sets, dictionaries, and other containers of elements.
* |Difference objects| characterize the discrepancies and deviations
  between a dataset and its requirements.
* |Acceptance managers| distinguish between ideal criteria and acceptable
  differences.

.. |data handling| replace:: :ref:`data handling <intro-automatic-data-handling>`

**Test driven data-wrangling** is a process for taking data from a source
of unverified quality or format and producing a verified, well-formatted
dataset. It repurposes software testing practices for data preparation
and quality assurance projects. **Pipeline validation** monitors the status
and quality of data as it passes through a pipeline and identifies *where*
in a pipeline an error occurs.

See the project `README <https://pypi.org/project/datatest/>`_ file for
full details regarding supported versions, backward compatibility, and
more.
