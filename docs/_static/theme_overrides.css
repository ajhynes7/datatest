    In the sphinx_rtd_theme (version 0.4.2, as of this update), table
    cells do not wrap text by default. This can make for unnecessarily
    wide tables that scroll off the page. The following declarations
    allow lines to wrap when the width is 445px or greater.

    This solution is adapted from ideas discussed on the following
    issue:
